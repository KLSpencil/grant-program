### Overview

Please provide the following:
DynamicEDI is a blockchain EDI(Electronic Data Interchange)  system focused on automating data exchange between business partners.  The app itself will 
integrate with multiple different EDI platforms (Intial platforms include Quantum Control(Oracle), Avsight(Salesforce) and Pentagon(MS-SQL) allowing 
data to be exchanged between business partners regardless of ERP software used.  

This project was born out of my 15 years of experiences as an ERP consultant in the aerospace industry. Many companies have the same issues with data 
and yet do not have any easy way of exchanging the data they need.  Most companies are still doing this manually over phone and email.  Most EDI vendors 
only support large companies leaving small to medium sized business to fend for themselves.  We will focus primarily on small-medium sized businesses 
first.

The app will integrate VIP191 fee delegation to eliminate the need for users to own any crypto themselves.   Transaction costs will be billed 
to customer on a monthly basis. VIP192 will be used to identification and authentication purpoes.   And VIP181 will be used for a future feature 
for Overhaul and Manufacturing certifications generated by vendors and to meet regulatory compliance needs. 


- A brief description of the project.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.
- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project. 

### Project Details

Project is primarily based on Python, Django and Postgres.  Some aspects will use other technoligies including Go, C#, Docker, and IPFS. 

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.


### Example Roadmap for a dApp Application

#### Overview

|  | Milestone 1 | Milestone 2 | Total |
| - | - |- | - |
| Estimated Duration | 30 d | 30 d | 60 d |
| Full-time equivalent (FTE) | 2 | 1 | 3 |
| Cost (up to $ 30,000) | $ 5,000 | $ 10,000 | $ 15,000|

#### Milestone 1 — Smart Contract & Backend

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
|-|-|-|
| 0a.| License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that can interact with the deployed smart contracts and backend service. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests |
| 1 | Smart Contracts | We will develop smart contracts that will...  (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the contracts) |
| 2 | Backend | "We will create a backend service that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the backend)" |

#### Milestone 2  —  Frontend

#### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce and publish at least one article/tutorial (e.g., on Medium). It should explain your work done as part of the grant.

## Future Plans

The intention of our team is to use this grant to complete the buildout of our project and turn it into a startup business and continue developing the 
software, add new features, and increase the number of ERP integrations and build out a network of companies using this.  My focus is primarily on the 
aerospace vertical as that is my primary experience and where most of my contacts are.  But I have contacts in the aftermarket automotive parts 
vertical, as well as pharmaceutical verticals to expand the network.  

Our goal is to bring to market an app that decentralizes and democratize EDI activities between companies.  


## Additional Information 

Any additional information that you think is relevant to this application that hasn't already been included.

Possible additional information to include:

- What work has been done so far?
- Are there any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
- Have you applied for other grants so far?

The basic infrastructure of our app is already functioning.  Messages can already be generated and transmitted over the Vechain network.  The app is 
dockerized and can easily be replicated for on-prem or cloud single-tenant deployment.    Currently all development has been self-funded.  No other 
grants have been applied for as of yet.  We are trying to move towards having a fully working MVP and integrated with at least two(2) ERP systems before 
seeking further funding.   We do have launch customers that have seen the product in its current state and are interested in deploying the app as soon as 
we can integrate with their ERP system.   Once we have customers that have validated the product we will be seeking further investment to fund security audits,  
as well as further EDI standards integration such as ISO-20022, HIPPAA EDI,  and other standards.
